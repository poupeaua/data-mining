# Data mining

This project gathers five projects done in ENSIMAG using Rstudio, thus R.

## TP1 -  Basic data mining & cofounding factors

Gaussian noise generation

## TP2 - Data Mining on Genetic Data

Regression, PCA, PCR, Cross-validation

## TP3 - Classification by Continent

Classification, Confusion matrix  (still with the same Genetic Data set)

## TP4 - Document classification

Naive-Bayes approach, Cross-validation

## TP5 - Graphs & community detection with different methods

Community detection :
  - Hierarchical Ascendant Clustering
  - Edge Betweeness
  - Spectral clustering and Louvain
